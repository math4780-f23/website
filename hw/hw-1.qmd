# Homework Instruction and Requirement
- Homework 1 covers course materials of Week 1 to 2.

- Please submit your work in **one** **PDF** file to **D2L > Assessments > Dropbox**. *Multiple files or a file that is not in pdf format are not allowed.*

- In your homework, please number and answer questions **in order**. 

- It is your responsibility to let me understand what you try to show. If you type your answers, make sure there are no typos. I grade your work based on *what you show, not what you want to show*. If you choose to handwrite your answers, write them neatly. If I canâ€™t read your sloppy handwriting, your answer is judged as wrong.

- **Relevant code should be attached.**


# Programming and Computing

Please sharpen your coding skill using R or any language you prefer. **No need** to show your work on this part!


# Probability and Statistics Review

<!-- We will use some facts or properties discussed in MATH 4700 and 4710. Here we don't learn why (which should be taught in MATH 4700 and 4710), but just know what they are, and apply them for regression analysis. -->


<!-- 1. Use the linearity of expected value $E(X+Y) = E(X) + E(Y)$ and $E(aX) = aE(X)$ where $X$ and $Y$ are random variables and $a$ is a constant to show that for a random variable $Y$, $$\mathrm{Var}(Y) = E(Y^2) - [E(Y)]^2$$ -->

1. $Y_1 \sim N(3, 8)$ and $Y_2 \sim N(1, 4)$, and $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ are independent. What is the distribution the variable $2Y_1 + 3Y_2$ follows?

<!-- 3. Suppose $Y_i \stackrel{iid}{\sim} N(\mu, \sigma^2)$, $i = 1, 2, \dots, n$. Show that $\overline{Y} \sim N\left(\mu,\frac{\sigma^2}{n} \right)$, where $\overline{Y} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i$. -->

<!-- 4. Let the sample variance be $S^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n(Y_i - \overline{Y})^2}{n-1}$. The two facts are -->
<!--     i. $\frac{(n-1)S^2}{\sigma^2} \sim \chi^2_{n-1}$ -->
<!--     ii. $\frac{\overline{Y} - \mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}$ and $\frac{(n-1)S^2}{\sigma^2}$ are independent.   -->
<!--     Use i. and ii. and the fact that *If $Z \sim N(0, 1)$, $V \sim \chi^2_v$ and $Z$ and $V$ are independent, then $\frac{Z}{\sqrt{V/v}} \sim t_{v}$* to show that $$\frac{\overline{Y} - \mu}{S/\sqrt{n}} \sim t_{n-1}$$ -->

2. Plot normal density curves with different choices of mean and standard deviation.

3. Install the R package `ISLR2`. Choose a continuous variable in the `ISLR2::Boston` data set. Use the `sample()` function to draw a simple random sample of size 20 from this population. Calculate the sample average.

4. Repeat the sampling in 3. several times to plot a sampling distribution of the sample mean.

5. Suppose $Y_i \stackrel{iid}{\sim} N(\mu, \sigma^2)$, $i = 1, 2, \dots, n$, with unknown $\mu$ and $\sigma$. The $100(1-\alpha)\%$ confidence interval (CI) for the population mean $\mu$ is $\left( \overline{y}- t_{\alpha/2, n-1}\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}, \overline{y} + t_{\alpha/2, n-1}\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} \right)$. Use simulation with $\alpha = 0.1$, $\mu = 4$ and $\sigma = 2$ to verify that such CIs contain $\mu$ about $100(1-\alpha)\%$ of times. Fill the percentage in the following table, and comment on your results.

|Simulation times   | $n=5$        |  $n=30$     | $n=200$
|------------------ | -------------|-------------|-----------
|$20$               | 
|$1000$             | 
|$20000$            |


6. If $U_1$ and $U_2$ are independent and both are uniform random variables over $[0, 1]$ interval <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_uniform_distribution>, then $X_1$ and $X_2$ defined by $$X_1 = \sqrt{-2\ln(U_1)}\cos(2\pi U_2), \quad X_2 = \sqrt{-2\ln(U_1)}\sin(2\pi U_2)$$ are independent $N(0, 1)$ variables. Draw 10,000 samples for $U_1$ and $U_2$ using the `runif()` function, and use the transformation to generate the samples of $X_1$ and $X_2$. Verify 
    - the standard normality of $X_1$ and $X_2$ by plotting their histogram with a superimposed standard normal density.
    - the independence of $X_1$ and $X_2$ by plotting the scatterplot of $X_1$ and $X_2$ and computing their correlation coefficient.

<!-- 7. **(MSSC)** Suppose $Y_i \stackrel{iid}{\sim} N(\mu, \sigma^2)$, $i = 1, 2, \dots, n$. Show that $\overline{Y} \sim N\left(\mu,\frac{\sigma^2}{n} \right)$, where $\overline{Y} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i$. -->
