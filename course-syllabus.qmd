## Office Hours

-   My in-person office hours are TuTh 3:20 - 4:50 PM, in Cudahy Hall room 353.

-   You are welcome to schedule an online meeting via Microsoft Teams if you need/prefer.

## Learning objectives

By the end of the semester, you will be able to...

-   analyze real data to answer questions about relationships among variables.
-   fit and evaluate linear and logistic regression models.
-   assess whether a proposed model is appropriate and describe its limitations.
-   communicate results from statistical analyses to a general audience.

## Prerequisites

-   MATH 2780 (Intro to Regression and Classification), MATH 4720 (Intro to Statistics) or equivalent.

-   Programming experience is helpful because the course involves doing regression analysis using [\textsf{R}](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) programming language.

-   Some linear algebra exposure at the level of MATH 3100 (Linear Algebra and Matrix Theory) would helps especially for MSSC 5780 students as some matrix operations are used for modeling and computation.

-   MSSC 5780 students, having taken MATH 4700 (Probability) and MATH 4710 (Statistical Inference) would help too.

-   Talk to me if you are not sure whether or not this is the right course for you.

## E-mail Policy

-   I will attempt to reply your email quickly, at least **within 24 hours**.

-   **Expect a reply on Monday if you send a question during weekends**. If you do not receive a response from me within two days, re-send your question/comment in case there was a "mix-up" with email communication (Hope this won't happen!).

-   Please start your subject line with **\[math4780\]** or **\[mssc5780\]** followed by a clear description of your question. See an example below.

![Email Subject Line Example](./images/email.png)

-   Email etiquette is important. Please read this [article](https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2015/04/16/advice-students-so-they-dont-sound-silly-emails-essay) to learn more about email etiquette.

-   I am more than happy to answer your questions about this course or statistics in general. However, due to time constraint, I may choose **NOT** to respond to students' e-mail if

    1.  The student could answer his/her own inquiry by reading the syllabus or information on the course website or D2L.

    2.  The student is asking for an extra credit opportunity. The answer is "no".

    3.  The student is requesting an extension on homework. The answer is "no".

    4.  The student is asking for a grade to be raised for no legitimate reason. The answer is "no".

    5.  The student is sending an email with no etiquette.

## Textbooks

<!-- ### Required Textbook -->

- [(**IS**) *Introduction to Statistics*](https://chenghanyu-introstatsbook.netlify.app/) by Cheng-Han Yu. (Good resource for brushing up your basic probability, statistics and simple linear regression knowledge.)

- [(**LRA**) *Introduction to Linear Regression Analysis, 6th edition*](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Introduction+to+Linear+Regression+Analysis%2C+6th+Edition-p-9781119578727), by D. C. Montgomery, E. A. Peck and G. G. Vining. Publisher: Wiley. (Graduate-level book that requires knowledge of matrix algebra.)

- [(**CAR**) *An R Companion to Applied Regression*](https://socialsciences.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Books/Companion/), by John Fox and Sanford Weisberg. Publisher: SAGE. (Doing regression much easier by the `car` and `effects` R packages.)

- [(**RD**) *Regression Daignostics*](https://socialsciences.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Books/RegressionDiagnostics/index.html), by John Fox. Publisher: SAGE. (Great concise book for learning regression diagnostics.)

- [(**CMR**) *Classical and Modern Regression with Applications*](https://www.amazon.com/Classical-Regression-Applications-Duxbury-Classic/dp/0534380166/ref=pd_lpo_14_t_0/135-5067421-1903413?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=0534380166&pd_rd_r=03ae154d-b095-4e98-9a72-e3dc30666c1f&pd_rd_w=tDw1K&pd_rd_wg=OIjNY&pf_rd_p=3b5203d9-bdd0-47f6-97e5-387010fc3251&pf_rd_r=PY1Q3JBBS4PS1M7D7DZF&psc=1&refRID=PY1Q3JBBS4PS1M7D7DZF), by Raymond Myers. Publisher: Duxbury Press. (The textbook when I was a master student.).


## Programming Languages

The default language of this course is \textsf{R}. Python code will be provided as well. Due to time constraint, I will NOT teach you \textsf{R} or Python programming from A to Z. If you never use R/Python and would like to grasp its syntax quickly, read my MATH 3570 R/Python programming slides on D2L. I am more than happy to answer any questions about \textsf{R} if you have any. There are a lot of online resources for learning \textsf{R} including the sites below.

-   [*Quick-R*](https://www.statmethods.net/index.html)

-   [*Hands-On Programming with R*](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/)

<!-- - [*A Student's Guide to R*](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Horton+Pruim+Kaplan_MOSAIC-StudentGuide.pdf)  -->

<!-- - [*R for Cats*](https://rforcats.net/)  -->

You may use any other language to complete your homework, exams and project. However, I will not debug your code or provide comments on any technical issues of those languages.

## Grading Policy

-   Students in this class range from juniors to second-year PhD students, so it makes sense to evaluate student performance using a different scale.

-   The homework/exams questions involving matrix algebra (MATH 3100) and calculus-based probability and statistical inference (MATH 4700/4710) are **optional** for MATH 4780 students.

-   For students in **MATH 4780**, the final grade is earned out of **1000 total points** distributed as follows:

    -   **Homework 1 to 6: 600 pts (100 pts each)**
    -   **Final project: 400 pts**
    -   **(Optional) MSSC problems: Up to extra 50 pts**

-   For students in **MSSC 5780**, the final grade is earned out of **1200 total points** distributed as follows:

    -   **Homework 1 to 6: 600 pts (100 pts each)**
    -   **Final project: 400 pts**
    -   **(Required) MSSC problems: 200 pts**

-   You will **NOT** be allowed any extra credit projects/homework/exam to compensate for a poor average. Everyone must be given the same opportunity to do well in this class. Individual exam will **NOT** be curved.

-   The final grade is based on your percentage of points earned out of 1000 or 1200 points and the grade-percentage conversion Table. $[x, y)$ means greater than or equal to $x$ and less than $y$. For example, 94.1 is in $[93, 100]$ and the grade is A and 92.8 is in $[90, 94)$ and the grade is A-.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
letter <- c("A", "A-", "B+", "B", "B-", "C+", "C", "C-",
                       "D+", "D", "F")
percentage <- c("[94, 100]", "[90, 94)", "[87, 90)", "[83, 87)", "[80, 83)",
                "[77, 80)", "[73, 77)", "[70, 73)", 
                "[65, 70)", "[60, 65)", "[0, 60)")
grade_dist <- data.frame(Grade = letter, Percentage = percentage)
knitr::kable(grade_dist, longtable = TRUE, caption = "Grade-Percentage Conversion")
```

-   This is not a course that gives most of students grade A. If you want to obtain a good grade, study hard. No pain, no gain.

## Homework

-   Homework will be assigned through the course website in weekly modules.

-   To submit your homework, please go to **D2L \> Assessments \> Dropbox** and upload your homework in **PDF** format.

<!-- - You have at least **one week** to finish your homework. -->

-   **Handwriting is not allowed for data analysis part**.

## Final Project

<!-- - There will be 2 in-class midterm exams and probably 1 final exam. -->

<!-- - Exam 1 and 2 have in-class part and take-home part. The in-class part tests your understanding of mathematical intuition of regression models. The take-home part tests your ability to do regression data analysis using computing software. -->

<!-- - The final exam is take-home.  -->

<!-- - For the take-home parts, **handwriting is not allowed for data analysis part**. -->

<!-- - Please go to **Assessments > Dropbox** to submit your take-home exams in **PDF** format. -->

<!-- - Exam 1 covers Week 1 to 6. Exam 2 covers Week 1 to 11. If there is one, the final exam is comprehensive and covers the **all course materials**. -->

-   A detailed final project guideline will be released later.

<!-- - Some questions are required for MSSC students. -->

<!-- - There are **NO make-up midterm exams** unless you miss exams due to COVID-19 symptoms, exposure, diagnosis, quarantine, and/or isolation, or you have an excused absence as defined in [Attendance in Academic Regulations](https://bulletin.marquette.edu/undergrad/academicregulations/#attendance). -->

<!-- - If you miss a midterm exam due to COVID-19 symptoms, exposure, diagnosis, quarantine, and/or isolation, or you have an excused absence as defined in [Attendance in Academic Regulations](https://bulletin.marquette.edu/undergrad/academicregulations/#attendance), the 120 pts will be added to your prorated final exam pts, i.e., (280 + 120 = 400) pts. If you miss two midterm exams, only one exam pts can be added to the final exam. You get 0 pt for the other exam. -->

<!-- - **NO make-up final exam/project** for any reason. -->
