## Logistic Regression

<!-- ISL 4.6 -->

1. Suppose we collect data for a group of students in a statistics class with variables $X_1 =$hours studied, $X_2 =$undergrad GPA, and $Y =$receive an A. We fit a logistic regression and produce estimated coefficient, $\hat{\beta_0} = âˆ’6$, $\hat{\beta_1} = 0.05$, $\hat{\beta_2} = 1$. 

    (a) Estimate the probability that a student who studies for 40 hours and has an undergrad GPA of 3.5 gets an A in the class.
    
    (b) How many hours would the student in part (a) need to study to have a 50% chance of getting an A in the class?
    
    
2. Split the `Boston` data set into training and test sets.

3. Using the training set, fit logistic regression to predict whether a given census tract in the test set has a crime rate above or below the median.
