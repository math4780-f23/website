## Diagnostics

<!-- Yu -->

1. This problem involves the `Boston` data set. We now try to predict per capita crime rate using the median value of owner-occupied homes.

    a. Fit a simple linear regression model. Check if there are any potential leverage points and     outliers.
    
    b. Check the normality, constant variance and linearity.
    
    c. Transform $y$ and/or $x$, and fit a new linear regression. Make sure it satisfies linear     regression assumptions.
