## Collinearity

<!-- ISL 3.14 -->

1. Perform the code

```{r}
#| eval: false
set.seed(1)
x1 <- runif(100)
x2 <- 0.5 * x1 + rnorm (100) / 10
y <- 2 + 2 * x1 + 0.3 * x2 + rnorm (100)
```


  Write out the form of the linear model. What are the regression coefficients?


2. Create a scatterplot displaying the relationship between `x1` and `x2`.


3. Fit a least squares regression to the data using `x1` and `x2`. How the LSEs relate to the true $\beta_0$, $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$? Can you reject $H0 : \beta_1 = 0$? How about $H0 : \beta_2 = 0$?


4. Fit a least squares regression using only `x1`. Comment on your results. Can you reject $H0 : \beta_1 = 0$?


5. Fit a least squares regression using only `x2`. Comment on your results. Can you reject $H0 : \beta_2 = 0$?


6. Do the results obtained in (3)â€“(5) contradict each other? Explain your answer.
