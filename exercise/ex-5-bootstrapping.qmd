## Bootstrapping Standard Deviation

<!-- ISL 5.9 -->


1. Based on the `Boston` data set, provide an estimate for the population
mean of `medv`. Call the estimate $\hat{\mu}$.

2. Provide an estimate of the standard error of $\hat{\mu}$. Interpret this
result. *Hint: We can compute the standard error of the sample mean by dividing the sample standard deviation by the square root of the number of observations.*

3. Estimate the standard error of $\hat{\mu}$ using the bootstrap. 

<!-- *Hint: We can use [boot::boot()](https://rdrr.io/cran/boot/man/boot.html) function.* -->
