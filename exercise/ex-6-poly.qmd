## Polynomial Regression


<!-- LRA 7.1 -->
1. Consider the values of x shown below: 
$$x = 1.00, 1.70, 1.25, 1.20, 1.45, 1.85, 1.60, 1.50, 1.95, 2.00$$ Suppose that we wish to fit a second-order model using these levels for the regressor variable $x$. Calculate the correlation between $x$ and $x^2$. Do you see any potential difficulties in fitting the model?




<!-- ISL 5.15 -->
2. Is there evidence of non-linear association between any of the predictors and the response `crim` in the `Boston` data set? To answer this question, for each predictor $X$, fit a model of the form 
$$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X+\beta_2X^2+\beta_3X^3+\epsilon$$
