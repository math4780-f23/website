I hope you have a great winter break. Welcome to 3570 Introduction to Data Science course. I am your instructor Cheng-Han Yu.\n\n-   First thing first. Get to know each other. Let me first introduce my self. I was born and grew up in Taipei, Taiwan, my home country, which is a island right next to China. Taipei is a big city in terms of population. It is about the same population size as Chicago. This building is called Taipei 101, which is the tallest building in Taiwan.\n:::\n\n## My Journey {background-image=\"images/01-syllabus/sample_gate.png\" background-size=\"cover\" background-position=\"50% 50%\" background-opacity=\"0.3\"}\n\n-   Assistant Professor (2020/08 - )\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](./images/01-syllabus/mu.svg){fig-align='center' width=20%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n-   Postdoctoral Fellow\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](./images/01-syllabus/rice.png){fig-align='center' width=20%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n-   PhD in Statistics\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](./images/01-syllabus/ucsc.png){fig-align='center' width=20%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n-   MA in Economics/PhD program in Statistics\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](./images/01-syllabus/iub.png){fig-align='center' width=20%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: notes\nAfter college, working and doing military service for several years, I came to the US for my PhD degree. Originally I would like to study economics, but then I switched my major to statistics.\n\n-   I got my master degree in economics from Indiana University Bloomington, then I transferred to UC Santa Cruz to finish my PhD studies.\n-   Then I spent two years doing my postdoctoral research at Rice University in Houston, Texas.\n-   Finally, in fall 2020, I came to Marquette as an assistant professor.\n-   Midwest/Indiana-West/California-South/Texas-Midwest/Wisconsin\n-   Been to any one of these universities/cities?\n-   The most beautiful campus.\n-   Who are international students? I can totally understand how hard studying and living in another country. Feel free to share your stories or difficulties, and I am more than happy to help you if you have any questions.\n-   Poor listening and speaking skills. I was shy.\n-   OK so, this is my background. How about you introducing yourself as well. You can share anything, your major, hobbies, your favorite food, what do you want to do after graduation, anything,\n-   I have the class list. I'd like to learn your face and remember your name. You know, you all wear a mask. It's hard to recognize you and connect your name and your face.\n-   When I call your name, you can say something about yourself. No need to be long, couple of seconds are good.\n:::\n\n## My Research\n\n-   Bayesian spatio-temporal modeling and machine learning algorithms in neuroimaging\n-   Bayesian Deep Learning for image classification\n-   Efficient MCMC for big $n$ big $p$ streaming data\n-   Game-based learning for STEM and data science education\n\n<br>\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n**fMRI**\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](./images/01-syllabus/activate.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n**EEG**\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](./images/01-syllabus/eeg.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n:::\n\n## How to Reach Me\n\n-   Office hours **TuTh 3:20 - 4:50 PM** in **Cudahy Hall 353**.\n-   📧 [cheng-han.yu\\@marquette.edu](mailto:cheng-han.yu@marquette.edu){.email}\n    -   Answer your question within 24 hours.\n    -   Expect a reply on **Monday** if shoot me a message **on weekends**.\n    -   Start your subject line with **\\[math4780\\]** or **\\[mssc5780\\]** followed by a **clear description of your question**.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](./images/01-syllabus/email.png){fig-align='center' width=45%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n-   I will **NOT** reply your e-mail if ... **Check the email policy in the [syllabus](https://math4780-f23.github.io/website/course-syllabus.html)**!\n\n## Textbook (LRA)\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n-   [*Introduction to Linear Regression Analysis, 6th edition*](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Introduction+to+Linear+Regression+Analysis%2C+6th+Edition-p-9781119578727), by D.

Sanford Weisberg is Professor Emeritus of statistics at the University of Minnesota. He has also served as the director of the University′s Statistical Consulting Service, and has worked with hundreds of social scientists and others on the statistical aspects of their research. He earned a BA in statistics from the University of California, Berkeley, and a Ph.D., also in statistics, from Harvard University\n:::\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n-   On bulletin: MATH 2780 (Baby Regression), MATH 4720 (Intro Stats) or equivalent.\n\n. . .\n\nHelpful if you\n\n-   code (any language) 💻\n\n. . .\n\n-   learned basic linear algebra (MATH 3100) 🔢\n\n. . .\n\n-   took probability (MATH 4700) and statistical inference (MATH 4710) 🎲\n\n::: notes\n-   On the Marquette bulletin, the prerequisite is either MATH 2780 or MATH 4720 or equivalent.\n-   But this course requires more than basic statistics experience.\n-   Nowadays, nobody is doing regression by hand, and we will write some code to do regression. So it would be helpful if you code any language before.\n:::\n\n## Course Website\n\n-   ([ ](https://math4780-f23.github.io/website/))\n    -   All course information and materials\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](./images/01-syllabus/logo.png){fig-align='center' width=50%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Course Website - D2L\n\n-   ([D2L](https://d2l.mu.edu/d2l/home/525088))\n    -   Homework submission\n    -   Gradebook\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](./images/01-syllabus/d2l_4780.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Grading Policy ✨\n\n-   For MATH 4780 (MSSC 5780) students, the grade is earned out of **1000 (1200) total points** distributed as follows:\n    -   **Homework 1 to 6: 600 pts (100 pts each)**\n    -   **Final project: 400 pts**\n    -   **MSSC 5780 problems: 200 pts**\n-   ❌ No extra credit projects/homework/exam to compensate for a poor grade.\n-   Individual grade will **NOT** be curved.\n-   Want to obtain a good grade?
