If you do not receive a response from me within two days, re-send your question/comment in case there was a \"mix-up\" with email communication (Hope this won't happen!).\n\n-   Please start your subject line with **\\[math4780\\]** or **\\[mssc5780\\]** followed by a clear description of your question. See an example below.\n\n![Email Subject Line Example](./images/email.png)\n\n-   Email etiquette is important. Please read this [article](https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2015/04/16/advice-students-so-they-dont-sound-silly-emails-essay) to learn more about email etiquette.\n\n-   I am more than happy to answer your questions about this course or statistics in general. However, due to time constraint, I may choose **NOT** to respond to students' e-mail if\n\n    1.  The student could answer his/her own inquiry by reading the syllabus or information on the course website or D2L.\n\n    2.  The student is asking for an extra credit opportunity. The answer is \"no\".\n\n    3.  The student is requesting an extension on homework. The answer is \"no\".\n\n    4.  The student is asking for a grade to be raised for no legitimate reason. The answer is \"no\".\n\n    5.  The student is sending an email with no etiquette.\n\n## Textbooks\n\n<!-- ### Required Textbook -->\n\n-   [(**IS**) *Introduction to Statistics*](https://chenghanyu-introstatsbook.netlify.app/) by Cheng-Han Yu. (Good resource for brushing up your basic probability, statistics and simple linear regression knowledge.)\n\n-   [(**LRA**) *Introduction to Linear Regression Analysis, 6th edition*](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Introduction+to+Linear+Regression+Analysis%2C+6th+Edition-p-9781119578727), by D. C. Montgomery, E. A. Peck and G. G. Vining. Publisher: Wiley. (Graduate-level book that requires knowledge of matrix algebra.)\n\n-   [(**CAR**) *An R Companion to Applied Regression*](https://socialsciences.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Books/Companion/), by John Fox and Sanford Weisberg. Publisher: SAGE. (Doing regression much easier by the `car` and `effects` R packages.)\n\n-   [(**RD**) *Regression Daignostics*](https://socialsciences.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Books/RegressionDiagnostics/index.html), by John Fox. Publisher: SAGE. (Great concise book for learning regression diagnostics.)\n\n-   [(**CMR**) *Classical and Modern Regression with Applications*](https://www.amazon.com/Classical-Regression-Applications-Duxbury-Classic/dp/0534380166/ref=pd_lpo_14_t_0/135-5067421-1903413?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=0534380166&pd_rd_r=03ae154d-b095-4e98-9a72-e3dc30666c1f&pd_rd_w=tDw1K&pd_rd_wg=OIjNY&pf_rd_p=3b5203d9-bdd0-47f6-97e5-387010fc3251&pf_rd_r=PY1Q3JBBS4PS1M7D7DZF&psc=1&refRID=PY1Q3JBBS4PS1M7D7DZF), by Raymond Myers. Publisher: Duxbury Press. (The textbook when I was a master student.).\n\n## Programming Languages\n\nThe default language of this course is \\textsf{R}. Python code will be provided as well. Due to time constraint, I will NOT teach you \\textsf{R} or Python programming from A to Z. If you never use R/Python and would like to grasp its syntax quickly, read my MATH 3570 R/Python programming slides on D2L. I am more than happy to answer any questions about \\textsf{R} if you have any. There are a lot of online resources for learning \\textsf{R} including the sites below.\n\n-   [*Quick-R*](https://www.statmethods.net/index.html)\n\n-   [*Hands-On Programming with R*](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/)\n\n<!-- - [*A Student's Guide to R*](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Horton+Pruim+Kaplan_MOSAIC-StudentGuide.pdf)  -->\n\n<!-- - [*R for Cats*](https://rforcats.net/)  -->\n\nYou may use any other language to complete your homework, exams and project. However, I will not debug your code or provide comments on any technical issues of those languages.\n\n## Grading Policy\n\n-   Students in this class range from juniors to second-year PhD students, so it makes sense to evaluate student performance using a different scale.\n\n-   The homework/exams questions involving matrix algebra (MATH 3100) and calculus-based probability and statistical inference (MATH 4700/4710) are **optional** for MATH 4780 students.\n\n-   For students in **MATH 4780**, the final grade is earned out of **1000 total points** distributed as follows:\n\n    -   **Homework 1 to 6: 600 pts (100 pts each)**\n    -   **In-class Exam: 120 pts**\n    -   **Final project: 220 pts**\n    -   **Class Participation: 60 pts**\n\n-   For students in **MSSC 5780**, the final grade is earned out of **1200 total points** distributed as follows:\n\n    -   **Homework 1 to 6: 600 pts (100 pts each)**\n    -   **In-class Exam: 120 pts**\n    -   **Final project: 220 pts**\n    -   **Class Participation: 60 pts**\n    -   **MSSC 5780 work: 200 pts**\n\n-   You will **NOT** be allowed any extra credit projects/homework/exam to compensate for a poor average. Everyone must be given the same opportunity to do well in this class. Individual exam will **NOT** be curved.\n\n-   The final grade is based on your percentage of points earned out of 1000 or 1200 points and the grade-percentage conversion Table. $[x, y)$ means greater than or equal to $x$ and less than $y$. For example, 94.1 is in $[93, 100]$ and the grade is A and 92.8 is in $[90, 94)$ and the grade is A-.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\nTable: Grade-Percentage Conversion\n\n|Grade |Percentage |\n|:-----|:----------|\n|A     |[94, 100]  |\n|A-    |[90, 94)   |\n|B+    |[87, 90)   |\n|B     |[83, 87)   |\n|B-    |[80, 83)   |\n|C+    |[77, 80)   |\n|C     |[73, 77)   |\n|C-    |[70, 73)   |\n|D+    |[65, 70)   |\n|D     |[60, 65)   |\n|F     |[0, 60)    |\n:::\n:::\n\n\n-   This is not a course that gives most of students grade A. If you want to obtain a good grade, study hard. No pain, no gain.\n\n## Homework\n\n-   Homework will be assigned through the course website in weekly modules.\n\n-   To submit your homework, please go to **D2L \\> Assessments \\> Dropbox** and upload your homework in **PDF** format.\n\n    -   [Combine images into a PDF file](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQxfU-r5qKs)\n    -   [Microsoft Word to PDF in 10 Seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibELbGJQTK8&feature=youtu.be)\n    -   [Convert images to PDF in Macbook/iMac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgsidiVdaRM)\n    -   [Combine two or more images to get a single PDF file](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/11163/how-do-i-combine-two-or-more-images-to-get-a-single-pdf-file)\n\n-   There will be 6 homework sets to be graded, Homework 1 to 6.\n\n-   Some questions are required for MSSC students.\n\n-   You will get a better understanding of the material if you discuss it with others. However, you must submit YOUR OWN work.\n\n-   **NO LATE HOMEWORK WILL BE ACCEPTED NOR WILL YOU BE ALLOWED TO MAKE UP MISSED HOMEWORK!**\n\n<!-- - You have at least **one week** to finish your homework. -->\n\n-   **Handwriting is not allowed for data analysis part**.\n\n## In-Class Exam\n\n-   The in-class exam covers materials in Week 1 to Week 7 on simple linear regression and multiple linear regression.\n\n-   Some questions are required for MSSC students.\n\n-   **NO make-up midterm exam** unless you miss exams due to COVID-19 symptoms, exposure, diagnosis, quarantine, and/or isolation, or you have an excused absence as defined in [Attendance in Academic Regulations](https://bulletin.marquette.edu/undergrad/academicregulations/#attendance).\n\n## Class Participation\n\n-   You will be presenting exercise problems.\n\n-   More details will be released later.\n\n## Final Project\n\n-   A detailed final project guideline will be released later.\n\n<!-- ## Final Project -->\n\n<!-- - There will be 2 in-class midterm exams and probably 1 final exam. -->\n\n<!-- - Exam 1 and 2 have in-class part and take-home part. The in-class part tests your understanding of mathematical intuition of regression models. The take-home part tests your ability to do regression data analysis using computing software. -->\n\n<!-- - The final exam is take-home.  -->\n\n<!-- - For the take-home parts, **handwriting is not allowed for data analysis part**. -->\n\n<!-- - Please go to **Assessments > Dropbox** to submit your take-home exams in **PDF** format. -->\n\n<!-- - Exam 1 covers Week 1 to 6. Exam 2 covers Week 1 to 11. If there is one, the final exam is comprehensive and covers the **all course materials**. -->\n\n<!-- -   A detailed final project guideline will be released later. -->\n\n<!-- - Some questions are required for MSSC students. -->\n\n<!-- - There are **NO make-up midterm exams** unless you miss exams due to COVID-19 symptoms, exposure, diagnosis, quarantine, and/or isolation, or you have an excused absence as defined in [Attendance in Academic Regulations](https://bulletin.marquette.edu/undergrad/academicregulations/#attendance). -->\n\n<!-- - If you miss a midterm exam due to COVID-19 symptoms, exposure, diagnosis, quarantine, and/or isolation, or you have an excused absence as defined in [Attendance in Academic Regulations](https://bulletin.marquette.edu/undergrad/academicregulations/#attendance), the 120 pts will be added to your prorated final exam pts, i.e., (280 + 120 = 400) pts. If you miss two midterm exams, only one exam pts can be added to the final exam. You get 0 pt for the other exam. -->\n\n<!-- - **NO make-up final exam/project** for any reason. -->\n\n## University and college policies\n\nAs a student in this course, you have agreed to comply with [Marquette undergraduate policies and regulations](https://bulletin.marquette.edu/policies/).\n\n<!-- ```{=html} -->\n\n<!-- <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_KN97j30ST4\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen> -->\n\n<!-- </iframe> -->\n\n<!-- ``` -->\n\n## Accommodation\n\nIf you need to request accommodations, or modify existing accommodations that address disability-related needs, please contact [Disability Service](https://www.marquette.edu/disability-services/).\n\n## Important dates\n\n-   **Sept 4:** Labor day\n-   **Sept 5:** Last day to add/swap/drop\n-   **Oct 19-20:** Midterm break\n-   **Nov 17:** Withdrawal deadline\n-   **Nov 22-26:** Thanksgiving\n-   **Dec 7**: Last day of class\n-   **Dec 19**: Final grade submission\n\nClick [here](https://www.marquette.edu/central/registrar/2023-fall-academic-calendar-.php) for the full Marquette academic calendar.\n",
