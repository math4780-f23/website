-   Hello everyone, how are you? I hope you have a great winter break. Welcome to 3570 Introduction to Data Science course. I am your instructor Cheng-Han Yu.

-   First thing first. Get to know each other. Let me first introduce my self. I was born and grew up in Taipei, Taiwan, my home country, which is a island right next to China. Taipei is a big city in terms of population. It is about the same population size as Chicago. This building is called Taipei 101, which is the tallest building in Taiwan.

::: notes
After college, working and doing military service for several years, I came to the US for my PhD degree. Originally I would like to study economics, but then I switched my major to statistics.

-   I got my master degree in economics from Indiana University Bloomington, then I transferred to UC Santa Cruz to finish my PhD studies.
-   Then I spent two years doing my postdoctoral research at Rice University in Houston, Texas.
-   Finally, in fall 2020, I came to Marquette as an assistant professor.
-   Midwest/Indiana-West/California-South/Texas-Midwest/Wisconsin
-   Been to any one of these universities/cities?
-   The most beautiful campus.
-   Who are international students? I can totally understand how hard studying and living in another country. Feel free to share your stories or difficulties, and I am more than happy to help you if you have any questions.
-   Poor listening and speaking skills. I was shy.
-   OK so, this is my background. How about you introducing yourself as well. You can share anything, your major, hobbies, your favorite food, what do you want to do after graduation, anything,
-   I have the class list. I'd like to learn your face and remember your name. You know, you all wear a mask. It's hard to recognize you and connect your name and your face.
-   When I call your name, you can say something about yourself. No need to be long, couple of seconds are good.

Publisher: Duxbury Press.
-   One of the textbooks when I was a master student at Indiana University Bloomington.
-   Outdated (published in 1990) and no code involved but explains concepts well.

::: notes
-   I also provide some other reference books. They are all optional, but some course materials may borrow from these books.
-   It's a pretty old book which was published in 1990. So it's a little bit outdated. But it explains basic ideas and concepts pretty well. I enjoyed reading it.

-   [*An R Companion to Applied Regression*](https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/an-r-companion-to-applied-regression/book246125), by John Fox and Sanford Weisberg. Publisher: SAGE.
-   R scripts and data are available on the [book Website](https://socialsciences.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Books/Companion/)
-   Doing regression much easier by the **car** and **effects** R packages.

:::
:::

::: notes
-   If you wanna learn how to use R to do regression, this book could be helpful.
-   The authors create 2 R packages car and effects that make doing regression so much easier.
-   Later you'll see we can just use some simple function calls to generate some important and useful graphics for regression analysis.

John Fox received a BA from the City College of New York and a PhD from the University of Michigan, both in Sociology. Sanford Weisberg is Professor Emeritus of statistics at the University of Minnesota. He has also served as the director of the University′s Statistical Consulting Service, and has worked with hundreds of social scientists and others on the statistical aspects of their research. He earned a BA in statistics from the University of California, Berkeley, and a Ph.D., also in statistics, from Harvard University

## Prerequisites

-   On bulletin: MATH 2780 (Baby Regression), MATH 4720 (Intro Stats) or equivalent.

. . .

Helpful if you

-   code (any language) `r emo::ji('computer')`

. . .

-   learned basic linear algebra (MATH 3100) `r emo::ji('1234')`

. . .

-   took probability (MATH 4700) and statistical inference (MATH 4710) `r emo::ji('game_die')`

::: notes
-   On the Marquette bulletin, the prerequisite is either MATH 2780 or MATH 4720 or equivalent.
-   But this course requires more than basic statistics experience.
-   Nowadays, nobody is doing regression by hand, and we will write some code to do regression. So it would be helpful if you code any language before.

## Grading Policy ✨

-   For MATH 4780 (MSSC 5780) students, the grade is earned out of **1000 (1200) total points** distributed as follows:
    -   **Homework 1 to 6: 600 pts (100 pts each)**
    -   **Final project: 400 pts**
    -   **MSSC 5780 problems: 200 pts**

-   `r emo::ji("x")` No extra credit projects/homework/exam to compensate for a poor grade.
-   Individual grade will **NOT** be curved.
-   Want to obtain a good grade? Study hard. No pain, no gain! ✍ ✍

::: notes
-   Everyone has the same opportunity to do well in this class.
-   4780 students are encouraged to do MSSC problems: Up to **100 pts** extra credit.
-   I am not a harsh grader, but this is not an easy A course as well.
:::

## Grade-Percentage Conversion

-   $[x, y)$ means greater than or equal to $x$ and less than $y$. For example, 94.0 is in \[94, 100\] and the grade is A and 93.8 is in \[90, 94) and the grade is A-.

```{r}
letter <- c("A", "A-", "B+", "B", "B-", "C+", "C", "C-",
                       "D+", "D", "F")
percentage <- c("[94, 100]", "[90, 94)", "[87, 90)", "[84, 87)", "[80, 84)",
                "[77, 80)", "[74, 77)", "[70, 74)", 
                "[65, 70)", "[60, 65)", "[0, 60)")
grade_dist <- data.frame(Grade = letter, Percentage = percentage)
library(kableExtra)
knitr::kable(grade_dist, longtable = TRUE, format = "html", align = 'l') %>% kable_styling(position = "center", font_size = 22)
```


## Homework (600 pts)

-   **D2L \> Assessments \> Dropbox** and upload your homework in **PDF** format.

-   You must submit YOUR OWN work. `r emo::ji("please")`

-   `r emo::ji("x")` **No make-up homework**.

-   Due **Friday 11:59 PM** (**09/09, 09/23, 10/07, 10/28, 11/11, 12/02. Hard deadline and no late submission**).

-   `r emo::ji("x")` **Handwriting is NOT allowed** for data analysis.

## MSSC 5780 Questions (200 pts)

-   Some extra homework questions are for MSSC 5780 students.
-   `r emo::ji('thumbsup')` MATH 4780 students are encouraged to do the MSSC problems to earn up to **50 pts** extra points.

## Project (400 pts)

-   You will be doing a team project.

-   Your project is about analyzing real-world data using regression methods.

-   Written report or oral presentation or both??

-   More information will be released later.

## What Computing Language We Use (I Teach)?

-   `r emo::ji("vulcan_salute")` The best language for statistical computing!

```{r}
#| out-width: "50%"
#| fig-align: "center"
#| fig-cap: '<a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R Website</a>'
knitr::include_graphics("./images/01-syllabus/Rlogo.png")
```

::: notes
-   R is the best language for statistical computing.
-   Its code for doing regression analysis is pretty clean and concise.
-   You won't regret learning R.
:::

## Which Programming Language?

-   `r emo::ji("white_check_mark")` May use *any other* language (Python, MATLAB, etc) to do your work.

-   `r emo::ji("x")` I would NOT debug your code or comment on your technical issues of those languages.

-   If time permitted, I'll translate R to Python.

## Academic Integrity

This course expects all students to follow University and College statements on [academic integrity](https://bulletin.marquette.edu/undergrad/academicregulations/).

-   **Honor Pledge and Honor Code**: *I recognize the importance of personal integrity in all aspects of life and work. I commit myself to truthfulness, honor, and responsibility, by which I earn the respect of others. I support the development of good character, and commit myself to uphold the highest standards of academic integrity as an important aspect of personal integrity. My commitment obliges me to conduct myself according to the Marquette University Honor Code*.
-   `r emo::ji("x")` You know what I am talking about. Yes, **DO NOT CHEAT**.

## [COVID-19](https://www.marquette.edu/coronavirus/) {visibility="hidden"}

*It is **your** responsibility as a Marquette University student to protect the health and safety of our community in this course. The University has mandated vaccination for all students for the academic year 2021-2022. COVID Cheq will still be used, but those fully vaccinated that provide documentation will no longer receive the daily symptom screening survey. Instead, they will receive a daily email providing a green check. You may be required to show your automated green check to show clearance for entry into campus buildings. If you are experiencing symptoms related to COVID-19, you must follow the link in the automated email to report symptoms.*

-   Visit [What to do if you are exposed to COVID-19 or test positive](https://www.marquette.edu/coronavirus/what-to-do-if-you-are-exposed-or-test-positive.php) website for university guidelines on the best course of action.

-   Visit guidance on Spring 2022 [Class attendance, withdrawal, and grading](https://www.marquette.edu/central/registrar/faculty-staff/guidance-on-fall-2021-class-attendance-withdrawal-grading.php)

    -   Students are responsible for contacting instructors **prior** to the missed class session to indicate absence and the need to make up classwork/assignments.\
    -   Students requesting make up classwork/assignments are required to provide the **COVID Cheq "stop sign"** to confirm inability to attend class.
