- Hello everyone, how are you? I hope you have a great winter break. Welcome to 3570 Introduction to Data Science course. I am your instructor Cheng-Han Yu.  

- First thing first. Get to know each other. Let me first introduce my self. I was born and grew up in Taipei, Taiwan, my home country, which is a island right next to China. Taipei is a big city in terms of population. It is about the same population size as Chicago. This building is called Taipei 101, which is the tallest building in Taiwan.

::: notes
After college, working and doing military service for several years, I came to the US for my PhD degree. Originally I would like to study economics, but then I switched my major to statistics. 

- I got my master degree in economics from Indiana University Bloomington, then I transferred to UC Santa Cruz to finish my PhD studies. 
- Then I spent two years doing my postdoctoral research at Rice University in Houston, Texas.
- Finally, in fall 2020, I came to Marquette as an assistant professor.
- Midwest/Indiana-West/California-South/Texas-Midwest/Wisconsin
- Been to any one of these universities/cities? 
- The most beautiful campus.
- Who are international students? I can totally understand how hard studying and living in another country. Feel free to share your stories or difficulties, and I am more than happy to help you if you have any questions.
- Poor listening and speaking skills. I was shy. 
- OK so, this is my background. How about you introducing yourself as well. You can share anything, your major, hobbies, your favorite food, what do you want to do after graduation, anything, 
- I have the class list. I'd like to learn your face and remember your name. You know, you all wear a mask. It's hard to recognize you and connect your name and your face. 
- When I call your name, you can say something about yourself. No need to be long, couple of seconds are good.

:::
- This is a real case happened last semester. A student of my class sent her homework of another class linear systems to me because the instructor of that course also has last name Yu, and she messed up. So if you remember to add course number in the subject line, it will greatly reduce the possibility of sending a wrong message. And it will save your time and my time, and so we all can work more efficiently. Right?

## What is This Course?
- **Every** *aspect of doing a practical data science project, from importing data to deploying what we learn from data*.
 
 
. . .

`r emo::ji("question")` **What are prerequisites?**  
`r emo::ji("point_right")` COSC 1010 (Intro Programming) and MATH 4720 (Intro Stats) or MATH 2780 (Intro Regression)

<br>

. . .

`r emo::ji("question")` **Is this like another intro stats course?**  
`r emo::ji("point_right")` No. Statistics and data science are closely related.  

. . .

Nowadays  
`r emo::ji("point_right")` Data science is a *broader* subject than statistics.  

. . .

`r emo::ji("point_right")` Statistics focuses more on *analyzing and learning from data*, a part of the entire workflow of data science.


<br>

. . .


`r emo::ji("question")` **Is this like another intro CS or programming course?**  
`r emo::ji("point_right")` Absolutely not. We learn how to **code for doing data science**, not for understanding computer systems and structures.

::: notes
- Of course we will not cover every detail form A to Z of DS in one semester becuase DS is such a huge subject, just like computer science. It's impossible to learn CS in one semester by just taking intro to CS, right? So we'll just learn the basic and essential concepts and tools used is DS.

## Grading Policy &#x2728;

- **40%** In-class lab exercises
- **30%** Homework
- **30%** Final project competition
<!-- Depending on the progress of the course,  -->
<!-- - There may be a midterm project proposal presentation, if time permitted.  -->
- `r emo::ji("x")` You have to participate (in-person) in the final presentation in order to pass the course.
- `r emo::ji("x")` You will **NOT** be allowed to do any extra credit projects/homework/exam to compensate for a poor grade. 
<!-- - I may use class participation to make grade adjustments at the end of the semester. -->

## Grade-Percentage Conversion
- $[x, y)$ means greater than or equal to $x$ and less than $y$. For example, 94.0 is in [94, 100] and the grade is A and 93.8 is in [90, 94) and the grade is A-.

```{r}
letter <- c("A", "A-", "B+", "B", "B-", "C+", "C", "C-",
                       "D+", "D", "F")
percentage <- c("[94, 100]", "[90, 94)", "[87, 90)", "[84, 87)", "[80, 84)",
                "[77, 80)", "[74, 77)", "[70, 74)", 
                "[65, 70)", "[60, 65)", "[0, 60)")
grade_dist <- data.frame(Grade = letter, Percentage = percentage)
library(kableExtra)
knitr::kable(grade_dist, longtable = TRUE, format = "html", align = 'l') %>% kable_styling(position = "center", font_size = 22)
```


## Lab Exercises (40%)

- The in-class lab exercises are graded as **complete/incomplete** and used as evidence of attendance and participation.

- You are allowed to have **one** incomplete lab exercises without any penalty.

- Beyond that, **2%** grade percentage will be taken off for each missing/incomplete exercise.

- You will create a R project saving all of your lab exercises. (We'll go through know-how together)

- `r emo::ji("x")` **No make-up lab exercises** for any reason.

## Homework (30%)
- The homework assignments are individual. Submit your own work. 

- `r emo::ji("x")` **You may not directly share or discuss answers/code with anyone other than the instructor**. But you are welcome to discuss the problems in general and ask for advice.

- Homework will be assigned through **GitHub**: 
  + clone/pull the homework repo into Posit Cloud
  + work on the Quarto file in the repo (We'll go through know-how together)
  
- You will have **at least one week** to complete your assignment.

- `r emo::ji("x")` **No make-up homework** for any reason unless you got [COVID](https://www.marquette.edu/central/registrar/faculty-staff/guidance-on-fall-2021-class-attendance-withdrawal-grading.php) or [excused absence](https://bulletin.marquette.edu/undergrad/academicregulations/#attendance). `r emo::ji("pray")` (More details in the syllabus)
